# Dummy score aligner

This is the starter code for developing new audio-to-score alignment plugins for the host application [*Piano Precision*](https://github.com/yucongj/piano-precision).

Please make sure you can run the build script first, e.g., `make -f Makefile.osx`. Then, follow the instructions here: [Developing Vamp aligner plugins](https://github.com/yucongj/piano-precision?tab=readme-ov-file#developing-vamp-aligner-plugins).
